The trajectory details the process of taking a non-functional full-stack application, LavApp, and making it operational. The initial state was a React frontend with a critical JSX compilation error and an unverified FastAPI backend. The first phase involved debugging and fixing this JSX error by cloning the correct repository version. Subsequent work focused on bringing the application to life by seeding the database with test data and correcting backend logic to handle data inconsistencies ( issues).

A significant challenge was resolving confusion between  and external preview URLs, which required reconfiguring environment variables. The core of the work involved implementing a complete client-side section from scratch, including registration, login, and a dashboard. This required deep debugging of the React  to fix state management and session persistence issues.

The final phase focused on building a complex appointment booking flow. This included creating a weekly calendar view, fetching dynamic configuration data (working hours, vehicle types), and ensuring the UI reflected this data accurately. The last action was fixing the calendar to correctly use dynamic data from the backend instead of hardcoded values, making it respect admin-configured working hours, days, and service durations.

<product_requirements>
The project is LavApp, a multi-tenant car wash management system built with FastAPI, React, and MongoDB.

**Core User Roles & Functionality:**
1.  **Super Admin:** Manages all car washes, approves payments, and sets global configurations.
2.  **Lavadero Admin:** Manages their specific car wash, including setting working hours, service prices by vehicle type, location, and managing bookings.
3.  **Client:** Can register, log in, browse available car washes, and book appointments.

**Work Implemented So Far:**
- The application was initially non-functional due to a JSX compilation error, which has been resolved.
- The backend and frontend have been successfully configured to communicate, and the database has been seeded with test data.
- The Super Admin and Lavadero Admin dashboards are functional.
- A real-time Open/Closed status for car washes, controlled by admins, is reflected on the homepage.
- A complete client section has been built, including registration, login, and a basic dashboard structure.
- The client-side appointment booking flow has been partially implemented. It now features a functional weekly calendar that displays available time slots based on the specific car wash's configured working days, hours, and service duration.

<key_technical_concepts>
- **Full-Stack Frameworks:** FastAPI (Python) for the backend, React for the frontend.
- **Database:** MongoDB, using UUIDs for IDs instead of ObjectIds.
- **Authentication:** JWT-based authentication for all user roles.
- **State Management (Frontend):** React Context API () to manage user session and authentication state across the application.
- **Process Management:** Supervisor is used to run and manage the frontend and backend services.
</key_technical_concepts>
<code_architecture>
The application follows a monolithic repository structure with separate directories for the backend and frontend.



- ****
  - **Importance:** This single file contains the entire FastAPI application, including all API endpoints, database models (Pydantic), authentication logic, and business logic for all user roles (Super Admin, Lavadero Admin, Client).
  - **Changes Made:** Numerous modifications were made, including fixing  exceptions, correcting database collection names, adding new endpoints like  and  to support the booking page, and adjusting existing endpoints to return data in the format expected by the frontend (e.g., transforming separate price fields into a  array).

- ****
  - **Importance:** This monolithic file contains the entire React application, including routing, state management (), and all components for the homepage, admin dashboards, and the newly implemented client section.
  - **Changes Made:** The file was heavily modified. Initially, a critical JSX error was fixed. Subsequently, several new components were added directly within this file: , , , , , and . The  was debugged and fixed to correctly manage user sessions. Conditional rendering was implemented to change the navbar and available actions based on the user's authentication status and role. The booking page was updated to use the new  component and fetch dynamic configuration from the backend.

- ****
  - **Importance:** A new script created to populate the empty MongoDB database with realistic test data for all user roles and car wash configurations, which was essential for debugging and development.
  - **Changes Made:** Created from scratch.
</code_architecture>
<pending_tasks>
- **Complete Booking Logic:** Implement backend validation to check for already booked time slots and manually blocked-off times by the admin.
- **Booking Confirmation:** Implement the functionality for a client to upload a payment proof image during booking.
- **Admin Booking Management:** Implement the interface for Lavadero Admins to view pending reservations, review payment proofs, and manually confirm or reject them. This action should block the time slot in the calendar.
- **Client Booking Management:** Create a My Bookings page for clients to view their appointment history and status (Pending, Confirmed, Completed, Cancelled).

<current_work>
The most recent work involved fixing the  (Weekly Calendar) component on the reservation page. The user reported that the calendar was not dynamically updating based on the settings configured in the Lavadero Admin dashboard. Specifically, it was using hardcoded values for:
1.  **Working Hours:** It displayed slots from 8 AM to 6 PM regardless of the admin's settings.
2.  **Working Days:** It showed Saturday as a working day even when it was disabled by the admin.
3.  **Service Duration:** The time slots were fixed at 60 minutes and did not adjust to changes like 90 minutes.

The issue was traced to the frontend component not correctly interpreting or applying the configuration data fetched from the backend. The fix involved adjusting the logic within the  component inside  to ensure it correctly generates the weekly view and time slots using the  prop, which holds the dynamic data (e.g., , , ). After applying the fixes and testing with a modified database configuration, the calendar now correctly reflects the admin's specific settings for working days, hours, and service duration.

<optional_next_step>
The next step is to implement the backend logic and API endpoints to check for appointment availability, considering already booked slots and manual blocks set by the admin.
